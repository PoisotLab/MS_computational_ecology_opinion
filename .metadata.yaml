  Computational ecology, defined as the application of computational thinking to

  ecological problems, has the potential to transform the way ecologists think

  about the integration of data and models. As the practice is gaining
  prominence

  as a way to conduct ecological research, it is important to reflect on what
  its

  agenda could be, and how it fits within the broader landscape. In this

  contribution, we suggest areas in which empirical ecologists, modellers, and
  the

  emerging community of computational ecologists could engage in a constructive

  dialogue to build on one another expertise. We discuss how training can be

  amended to improve the computational literacy of ecologists can be improved.
