    caption: Methods of ecological research can be (roughly) classified in four quadrats, based on whether they suggest or document mechanisms and relationships, and whether they integrate or dissociate models and raw data. Although crude, this classification helps understanding what computational approaches can bring to the global research effort.

    caption: Research methodologies differ on the basis of their costs, and on the type of predictions they make. Computational ecology is justified only in the context of an interaction with observational or manipulative approaches; specifically, only observations can validate predictions. Modelling studies are extremely accurate, but their testability is low. Computational approaches generate highly testable predictions, but their accuracy is currently difficult to assess (and should therefore be considered low). Observational or manipulative studies are extremely accurate, and can inform and refine predictions generated through computational approaches.

    caption: Relationships between the key concepts discussed in this manuscript. Components of the computational approach are highlighted in blue. The advantage of computational approaches is that they exist within a direct feedback loop from data to hypothesis, while not being disconnected from the rest of the ecological praxis.
