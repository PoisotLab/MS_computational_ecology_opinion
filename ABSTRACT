Computational ecology, defined as the application of computational thinking to
ecological problems, has the potential to transform the way ecologists think
about the integration of data and models. As the practice is gaining prominence
as a way to conduct ecological research, it is important to reflect on what its
agenda could be, and how it fits within the broader landscape. In this
contribution, we suggest areas in which empirical ecologists, modellers, and the
emerging community of computational ecologists could engage in a constructive
dialogue to build on one another expertise. We discuss how training can be
amended to improve the computational literacy of ecologists can be improved.
