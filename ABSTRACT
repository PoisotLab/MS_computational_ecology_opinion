Computational ecology, defined as the application of computational thinking to
ecological problems, has the potential to transform the way ecologists think
about the integration of data and models. As the practice is gaining prominence
as a way to conduct ecological research, it is important to reflect on what its
agenda could be, and how it fits within the broader landscape. In this
contribution, we suggest areas in which empirical ecologists, modellers, and the
emerging community of computational ecologists could engage in a constructive
dialogue to build on one another expertise; specifically, about the need to make
predictions from models actionable, about the best standards to represent
ecological data, and about the proper ways to credit data collection and data
reuse. We discuss how training can be amended to improve computational literacy.
