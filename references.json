To do so, we conducted an online survey. The 937 respondents were mostly early-career scientists who studied biology as undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of quantitative training: 75% were not satisfied with their understanding of mathematical models; 75% felt that the level of mathematics was \"too low\" in their ecology classes; 90% wanted more mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95% more statistics classes. Respondents thought that 30% of classes in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing programs. The main suggestion to improve quantitative training was to relate theoretical and statistical modeling to applied ecological problems. Improving quantitative training will require dedicated, quantitative classes for ecology-related degrees that contain good mathematical and statistical practice.","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.285","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Barraquand","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Ezard","given":"Thomas H.

Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002053","DOI":"10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00205-3","ISSN":"0304-3800","author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"M.

  {"id":"LettKe16","type":"article-journal","title":"Linking modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","page":"n/a-n/a","source":"Wiley Online Library","abstract":"Modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory represent parallel frameworks for understanding the niche's role in species coexistence. Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show for a general consumer-resource model that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalisations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.

The concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers, constitutes “open science.” Despite the many benefits of an open approach to science, a number of barriers to entry exist that may prevent researchers from embracing openness in their own work. Here we describe several key shifts in mindset that underpin the transition to more open science. These shifts in mindset include thinking about data stewardship rather than data ownership, embracing transparency throughout the data life-cycle and project duration, and accepting critique in public. Though foreign and perhaps frightening at first, these changes in thinking stand to benefit the field of ecology by fostering collegiality and broadening access to data and findings. We present an overview of tools and best practices that can enable these shifts in mindset at each stage of the research process, including tools to support data management planning and reproducible analyses, strategies for soliciting constructive feedback throughout the research process, and methods of broadening access to final research products.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00402.1/abstract","DOI":"10.1890/ES14-00402.1","ISSN":"2150-8925","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hampton","given":"Stephanie E."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Sean S."},{"family":"Bagby","given":"Sarah C."},{"family":"Gries","given":"Corinna"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xueying"},{"family":"Hart","given":"Edmund M."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Matthew B."},{"family":"Lenhardt","given":"W.

To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12757/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12757","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Ovaskainen","given":"Otso"},{"family":"Tikhonov","given":"Gleb"},{"family":"Norberg","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Guillaume Blanchet","given":"F."},{"family":"Duan","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Dunson","given":"David"},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Abrego","given":"Nerea"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,22]]},"title-short":"How to make more out of community data?","container-title-short":"Ecol Lett"},

However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long-term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15–30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long-term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06512.html","DOI":"10.1038/nature06512","ISSN":"0028-0836","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Benincà","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Huisman","given":"Jef"},{"family":"Heerkloss","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Jöhnk","given":"Klaus D."},{"family":"Branco","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Van Nes","given":"Egbert H."},{"family":"Scheffer","given":"Marten"},{"family":"Ellner","given":"Stephen P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,2,14]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,2]]},"container-title-short":"Nature"},

The recognition that even simple ecological systems can undergo chaotic behaviour has made chaos a topic of considerable interest among theoretical ecologists. However, there is still a lack of experimental evidence that chaotic behaviour occurs in the real world of coexisting populations in multi-species systems. Here we study the dynamics of a defined predator–prey system consisting of a bacterivorous ciliate and two bacterial prey species. The bacterial species preferred by the ciliate was the superior competitor. Experimental conditions were kept constant with continuous cultivation in a one-stage chemostat. We show that the dynamic behaviour of such a two-prey, one-predator system includes chaotic behaviour, as well as stable limit cycles and coexistence at equilibrium. Changes in the population dynamics were triggered by changes in the dilution rates of the chemostat. The observed dynamics were verified by estimating the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Such a defined microbial food web offers a new possibility for the experimental study of deterministic chaos in real biological systems.","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7046/full/nature03627.html","DOI":"10.1038/nature03627","ISSN":"0028-0836","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Becks","given":"Lutz"},{"family":"Hilker","given":"Frank M."},{"family":"Malchow","given":"Horst"},{"family":"Jürgens","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Arndt","given":"Hartmut"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,6,30]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,2]]},"container-title-short":"Nature"},

Despite this interdependence, many empirical studies build largely on other empirical studies with little direct reference to relevant theory, suggesting a failure of communication that may hinder scientific progress. To investigate the extent of this problem, we analyzed how the use of mathematical equations affects the scientific impact of studies in ecology and evolution. The density of equations in an article has a significant negative impact on citation rates, with papers receiving 28% fewer citations overall for each additional equation per page in the main text. Long, equation-dense papers tend to be more frequently cited by other theoretical papers, but this increase is outweighed by a sharp drop in citations from nontheoretical papers (35% fewer citations for each additional equation per page in the main text). In contrast, equations presented in an accompanying appendix do not lessen a paper’s impact. Our analysis suggests possible strategies for enhancing the presentation of mathematical models to facilitate progress in disciplines that rely on the tight integration of theoretical and empirical work.","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1205259109","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Fawcett","given":"T.

Since then, we have seen several notable corpora that are about 100 times larger, and in 2006, Google released a trillion-word corpus with frequency counts for all sequences up to five words long. In some ways this corpus is a step backwards from the Brown Corpus: it's taken from unfiltered Web pages and thus contains incomplete sentences, spelling errors, grammatical errors, and all sorts of other errors. It's not annotated with carefully hand-corrected part-of-speech tags. But the fact that it's a million times larger than the Brown Corpus outweighs these drawbacks. A trillion-word corpus - along with other Web-derived corpora of millions, billions, or trillions of links, videos, images, tables, and user interactions - captures even very rare aspects of human behavior. So, this corpus could serve as the basis of a complete model for certain tasks - if only we knew how to extract the model from the data.","DOI":"10.1109/MIS.2009.36","ISSN":"1541-1672","author":[{"family":"Halevy","given":"A."},{"family":"Norvig","given":"P."},{"family":"Pereira","given":"F."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]},"container-title-short":"IEEE Intell.

This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species’ presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12770/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12770","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Staniczenko","given":"Phillip P.A."},{"family":"Sivasubramaniam","given":"Prabu"},{"family":"Suttle","given":"K.

  {"id":"DAmMate17","type":"article-journal","title":"Improving spatial predictions of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity","container-title":"Journal of Ecology","source":"CrossRef","abstract":"1.In this study, we compare two community modelling approaches to determine their ability to predict the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic properties of plant assemblages along a broad elevation gradient and at a fine resolution. The first method is the standard stacking individual species distribution modelling (SSDM) approach, which applies a simple environmental filter to predict species assemblages. The second method couples the SSDM and macroecological modelling (MEM - SSDM-MEM) approaches to impose a limit on the number of species co-occurring at each site. Because the detection of diversity patterns can be influenced by different levels of phylogenetic or functional trees, we also examine whether performing our analyses from broad to more exact structures in the trees influences the performance of the two modelling approaches when calculating diversity indices. 2.We found that coupling the SSDM with the MEM improves the overall predictions for the three diversity facets compared with those of the SSDM alone. The accuracy of the SSDM predictions for the diversity indices varied greatly along the elevation gradient, and when considering broad to more exact structure in the functional and phylogenetic trees, the SSDM-MEM predictions were more stable. 3.SSDM-MEM moderately but significantly improved the prediction of taxonomic diversity, which was mainly driven by the corrected number of predicted species. The performance of both modelling frameworks increased when predicting the functional and phylogenetic diversity indices. In particular, fair predictions of the taxonomic composition by SSDM-MEM led to increasingly accurate predictions of the functional and phylogenetic indices, suggesting that the compositional errors were associated with species that were functionally or phylogenetically close to the correct ones; however, this did not always hold for the SSDM predictions. 4.Synthesis. In this study, we tested the use of a recently published approach that couples species distribution and macroecological models to provide the first predictions of the distribution of multiple facets of plant diversity: taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic. Moderate but significant improvements were obtained; thus, our results open promising avenues for improving our ability to predict the different facets of biodiversity in space and time across broad environmental gradients when functional and phylogenetic information is available.

Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species’ phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species’ interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species’ interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3644","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.3644","author":[{"family":"Desjardins-Proulx","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Laigle","given":"Idaline"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]}},

While the number of forecasts for biodiversity is increasing, there is little information available on how well these forecasts work. Most biodiversity forecasts are not evaluated to determine how well they predict future diversity, fail to account for uncertainty, and do not use time-series data that captures the actual dynamics being studied. We addressed these limitations by using best practices to explore our ability to forecast the species richness of breeding birds in North America. We used hindcasting to evaluate six different modeling approaches for predicting richness. Hindcasts for each method were evaluated annually for a decade at 1,237 sites distributed throughout the continental United States. While each model could explain most of the variance in richness, none of them consistently outperformed a baseline model that predicted constant richness at each site. In particular, we found no evidence that current methods (such as species distribution models) can successfully turn spatial data into useful temporal predictions about biodiversity at decadal time-scales. The best practices implemented in this study directly influence the forecasts, the relative performance of different modeling approaches, and the conclusions about the current state of biodiversity forecasting . To facilitate the rapid improvement of biodiversity forecasts, we emphasize the value of specific best practices in making forecasts and evaluating forecasting methods.","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/20/191130","DOI":"10.1101/191130","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"David J."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Shawn"},{"family":"White","given":"Ethan P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,20]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,21]]}},

This observation is perhaps unsurprising, because population dynamics are often strongly forced and highly nonlinear. Recently, however, numerous statistical techniques have been proposed for fitting highly parameterized mechanistic models to complex time series, potentially providing the machinery necessary for generating useful predictions. Alternatively, there is a wide variety of comparatively simple model-free forecasting methods that could be used to predict abundance. Here we pose a rather conservative challenge and ask whether a correctly specified mechanistic model, fit with commonly used statistical techniques, can provide better forecasts than simple model-free methods for ecological systems with noisy nonlinear dynamics. Using four different control models and seven experimental time series of flour beetles, we found that Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures for fitting mechanistic models often converged on best-fit parameterizations far different from the known parameters. As a result, the correctly specified models provided inaccurate forecasts and incorrect inferences. In contrast, a model-free method based on state-space reconstruction gave the most accurate short-term forecasts, even while using only a single time series from the multivariate system. Considering the recent push for ecosystem-based management and the increasing call for ecological predictions, our results suggest that a flexible model-free approach may be the most promising way forward.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/13/5253","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1216076110","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Perretti","given":"Charles T."},{"family":"Munch","given":"Stephan B."},{"family":"Sugihara","given":"George"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,26]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,10]]},"PMID":"23440207","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

Science is traditionally founded on theories and models, most often formalized with mathematical formulas handcrafted by theoretical scientists and refined through experiments. Machine learning, an important branch of modern Artificial Intelligence, focuses on learning from data. This leads to a fundamentally different approach to model-building: we step back and focus on the design of algorithms capable of building models from data, but the models themselves are not designed by humans. This is even more true with deep learning, which requires little engineering by hand and is responsible for many of Artificial Intelligence's spectacular successes. In contrast to logic systems, knowledge from a deep learning model is difficult to understand, reuse, and may involve up to a billion parameters. On the other hand, probabilistic machine learning techniques such as deep learning offer an opportunity to tackle large complex problems that are out of the reach of traditional theory-making. It is possible that the more intuition-like reasoning performed by deep learning systems is mostly incompatible with the logic formalism of mathematics. Yet recent studies have shown that deep learning can be useful to logic systems and vice versa. Success at unifying different paradigms of Artificial Intelligence from logic to probability theory offers unique opportunities to combine data-driven approaches with traditional theories. These advancements are susceptible to impact significantly biological sciences, where dimensionality is high and limit the investigation of traditional theories.","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/22/161125","DOI":"10.1101/161125","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Desjardins-Proulx","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,22]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,3]]}},

Reproducibility is an essential requirement of good science and arises from the ability to develop models that make accurate predictions on new data. Ecology, however, with a few exceptions, has abandoned prediction as a central focus and faces its own crisis of reproducibility. Models are where ecological understanding is stored and they are the source of all predictions – no prediction is possible without a model of the world. Models can be improved in three ways: model variables, functional relationships among dependent and independent variables, and in parameter estimates. Ecologists rarely test to assess whether new models have made advances by identifying new and important variables, elucidating functional relationships, or improving parameter estimates. Without these tests it is difficult to know if we understand more today than we did yesterday. A new commitment to prediction in ecology would lead to, among other things, more mature (i.e. quantitative) hypotheses, prioritization of modeling techniques that are more appropriate for prediction (e.g. using continuous independent variables rather than categorical) and, ultimately, advancement towards a more general understanding of the natural world. \nSynthesis\nEcology, with a few exceptions, has abandoned prediction and therefore the ability to demonstrate understanding. Here we address how this has inhibited progress in ecology and explore how a renewed focus on prediction would benefit ecologists. The lack of emphasis on prediction has resulted in a discipline that tests qualitative, imprecise hypotheses with little concern for whether the results are generalizable beyond where and when the data were collected. A renewed commitment to prediction would allow ecologists to address critical questions about the generalizability of our results and the progress we are making towards understanding the natural world.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.03726/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/oik.03726","ISSN":"1600-0706","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Houlahan","given":"Jeff E."},{"family":"McKinney","given":"Shawn T."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"T.

Presence-only species distribution models are commonly used in these evaluations, however they are rarely tested with independent data over time or compared with presence-absence models fit with the same presence data. Using Maxent, we developed a presence-only model of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) distribution in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA in 2007 fit with limited data, and then tested the model with independent presence and absence data collected between 2008 and 2013. This model was verified using threshold dependent and threshold independent evaluation metrics. Next, we developed a Maxent model with cheatgrass presence data from 2007 through 2013 (i.e. Maxent 2013), and compared this model to a presence-absence method (i.e., generalized linear model; GLM 2013) using the same data. Threshold dependent and threshold independent evaluation metrics suggested Maxent 2013 outperformed GLM 2013, and a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test indicated relative probability outputs were not significantly different between the models in geographic space. Based on known presences and absences of cheatgrass collected in the field, the Maxent 2013 and GLM 2013 relative probability outputs were highly correlated at absence locations but less correlated at presence locations. A Kappa comparison of Maxent 2007 and Maxent 2013 binary output provides evidence that Maxent is robust when fit with limited data. Our results indicate Maxent is an appropriate model for use when land management objectives are supported by limited resources and thus require a conservative, but highly accurate estimate of habitat suitability for invasive species on the landscape.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954116301923","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2016.11.001","ISSN":"1574-9541","author":[{"family":"West","given":"Amanda M."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Sunil"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Cynthia S"},{"family":"Stohlgren","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Bromberg","given":"Jim"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,24]]},"container-title-short":"Ecological Informatics"},

In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to “spatial sorting bias”: the difference between the geographic distance from testing-presence to training-presence sites and the geographic distance from testing-absence (or testing-background) to training-presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross-validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results (AUC) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than MaxEnt for 45% and better than Bioclim for 67% of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver–operator curve (AUC) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random-absence data instead of independently obtained presence–absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This adjustment strongly decreased AUC values and changed the ranking among species. Cross-validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/11-0826.1/abstract","DOI":"10.1890/11-0826.1","ISSN":"1939-9170","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hijmans","given":"Robert J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,24]]},"title-short":"Cross-validation of species distribution models"},

The implicit assumption is that this will increase knowledge and, in turn lead to better decision-making. However, the justification for this assumption remains uncertain, not least because the definition of ‘prediction’ is unclear. We propose that two types of prediction should be distinguished: corroboratory-prediction is linked to the validation of theories; and anticipatory-prediction is linked to the description of possible futures. We then discuss four families of obstacles to prediction, linked to the specific features of ecosystems: 1) they are historical entities, 2) they are complex, 3) their dynamics are stochastic, and 4) they are influenced by socio-economic drivers. A naïve understanding of ecological science suggests that the two types of predictions are simply two phases in a sequence in which scientists first improve their knowledge of ecological systems via corroboratory-predictions, and then apply this knowledge in order to forecast future states of ecosystems via anticipatory-predictions in order to help policy makers taking decisions. This sequence is however not straightforward, partly because corroboration and anticipation are not affected by the obstacles to prediction in the same way. We thus invite to reconsider the role of ecological prediction as a tool in a deliberative model of decision-making rather than as external scientific information aimed at enlightening the political process. Doing so would be beneficial for both the policy-relevance of anticipatory-prediction and the theoretical-relevance of corroboratory-prediction.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.04655/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/oik.04655","ISSN":"1600-0706","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Maris","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Huneman","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Coreau","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Kéfi","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Pradel","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Devictor","given":"Vincent"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,12]]},"title-short":"Prediction in ecology","container-title-short":"Oikos"},

Yet, most species remain unknown or unstudied, while others attract most of the public, scientific and government attention. Although known to be detrimental, this taxonomic bias continues to be pervasive in the scientific literature, but is still poorly studied and understood. Here, we used 626 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the biggest biodiversity data portal, to characterize the taxonomic bias in biodiversity data. We also investigated how societal preferences and taxonomic research relate to biodiversity data gathering. For each species belonging to 24 taxonomic classes, we used the number of publications from Web of Science and the number of web pages from Bing searches to approximate research activity and societal preferences. Our results show that societal preferences, rather than research activity, strongly correlate with taxonomic bias, which lead us to assert that scientists should advertise less charismatic species and develop societal initiatives (e.g. citizen science) that specifically target neglected organisms. Ensuring that biodiversity is representatively sampled while this is still possible is an urgent prerequisite for achieving efficient conservation plans and a global understanding of our surrounding environment.","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09084-6","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-09084-6","ISSN":"2045-2322","language":"En","author":[{"family":"Troudet","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Grandcolas","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Blin","given":"Amandine"},{"family":"Vignes-Lebbe","given":"Régine"},{"family":"Legendre","given":"Frédéric"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,22]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,17]]},"container-title-short":"Sci.

Based on an analysis of common threats affecting vertebrates and invertebrates, we suggest a path forward for narrowing the research gap between threatened vertebrates and invertebrates.","URL":"http://facetsjournal.com/article/facets-2016-0011/","DOI":"10.1139/facets-2016-0011","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Donaldson","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Burnett","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Braun","given":"Douglas C."},{"family":"Suski","given":"Cory D."},{"family":"Hinch","given":"Scott G."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Kerr","given":"Jeremy T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,26]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,17]]}},

By comparing four different citizen science projects, we explore how the sampling design's complexity affects the role of these spatial biases.\n\n\nLocation\n\nDenmark, Europe.\n\n\nMethods\n\nWe used a point process model to estimate the effect of land cover and human infrastructure on the intensity of observations from four different citizen science species recording schemes. We then use these results to predict areas of under- and oversampling as well as relative biodiversity ‘hotspots’ and ‘deserts’, accounting for common spatial biases introduced in unstructured sampling designs.\n\n\nResults\n\nWe demonstrate that the explanatory power of spatial biases such as infrastructure and human population density increased as the complexity of the sampling schemes decreased. Despite a low absolute sampling effort in agricultural landscapes, these areas still appeared oversampled compared to the observed species richness. Conversely, forests and grassland appeared undersampled despite higher absolute sampling efforts. We also present a novel and effective analytical approach to address spatial biases in unstructured sampling schemes and a new way to address such biases, when more structured sampling is not an option.\n\n\nMain conclusions\n\nWe show that citizen science datasets, which rely on untrained amateurs, are more heavily prone to spatial biases from infrastructure and human population density. Objectives and protocols of mass-participating projects should thus be designed with this in mind. Our results suggest that, where contextual data is available, modelling the intensity of individual observation can help understand and quantify how spatial biases affect the observed biological patterns.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12477/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ddi.12477","ISSN":"1472-4642","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Geldmann","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Heilmann-Clausen","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Holm","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"Levinsky","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Markussen","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Olsen","given":"Kent"},{"family":"Rahbek","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Tøttrup","given":"Anders P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,17]]},"title-short":"What determines spatial bias in citizen science?","container-title-short":"Diversity Distrib."},

These data are temporally and spatially dispersed and could have limitations regarding biases in the distribution of the observations in space and/or time. In this work, we test the influence of landscape variables in the distribution of citizen science observations for eight taxonomic groups. We use data collected through a Portuguese citizen science database (biodiversity4all.org). We use a zero-inflated negative binomial regression to model the distribution of observations as a function of a set of variables representing the landscape features plausibly influencing the spatial distribution of the records. Results suggest that the density of paths is the most important variable, having a statistically significant positive relationship with number of observations for seven of the eight taxa considered. Wetland coverage was also identified as having a significant, positive relationship, for birds, amphibians and reptiles, and mammals. Our results highlight that the distribution of species observations, in citizen science projects, is spatially biased. Higher frequency of observations is driven largely by accessibility and by the presence of water bodies. We conclude that efforts are required to increase the spatial evenness of sampling effort from volunteers.","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13130-8","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-13130-8","ISSN":"2045-2322","language":"En","author":[{"family":"Tiago","given":"Patrícia"},{"family":"Ceia-Hasse","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Marques","given":"Tiago A."},{"family":"Capinha","given":"César"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Henrique M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,16]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,17]]},"container-title-short":"Sci.

Understanding the dynamics of those ecosystems can help us better maintain or control them. Yet, reverse-engineering complex ecosystems (i.e., extracting their dynamic models) directly from measured temporal data has not been very successful so far. Here we propose to close this gap via symbolic regression. We validate our method using both synthetic and real data. We firstly show this method allows reverse engineering two-species ecosystems, inferring both the structure and the parameters of ordinary differential equation models that reveal the mechanisms behind the system dynamics. We find that as the size of the ecosystem increases or the complexity of the inter-species interactions grow, using a dictionary of known functional responses (either previously reported or reverse-engineered from small ecosystems using symbolic regression) opens the door to correctly reverse-engineer large ecosystems.","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/11/074617","DOI":"10.1101/074617","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yize"},{"family":"Angulo","given":"Marco Tulio"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang-Yu"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,12]]}},

Unfortunately, most ecological forecasts focus on centennial-scale climate responses, therefore neither meeting the needs of near-term (daily to decadal) environmental decision-making nor allowing comparison of specific, quantitative predictions to new observational data, one of the strongest tests of scientific theory. Near-term forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability, latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists have made considerable advances in applying computational, informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and cyberinfrastructure. Effective forecasting will also require changes in scientific training, culture, and institutions. The need to start forecasting is now; the time for making ecology more predictive is here, and learning by doing is the fastest route to drive the science forward.</p>","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/29/1710231115","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1710231115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Dietze","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Fox","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Beck-Johnson","given":"Lindsay M."},{"family":"Betancourt","given":"Julio L."},{"family":"Hooten","given":"Mevin B."},{"family":"Jarnevich","given":"Catherine S."},{"family":"Keitt","given":"Timothy H."},{"family":"Kenney","given":"Melissa A."},{"family":"Laney","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Laurel G."},{"family":"Loescher","given":"Henry W."},{"family":"Lunch","given":"Claire K."},{"family":"Pijanowski","given":"Bryan C."},{"family":"Randerson","given":"James T."},{"family":"Read","given":"Emily K."},{"family":"Tredennick","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Vargas","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Weathers","given":"Kathleen C."},{"family":"White","given":"Ethan P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,30]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,23]]},"PMID":"29382745","title-short":"Iterative near-term ecological forecasting","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform. Iterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We demonstrate how automated iterative near-term forecasting systems for ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long-term study with over 40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data sharing, data manipulation, modeling and forecasting, archiving, and presentation of the forecasts. The forecasting system uses R code for working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long-term maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models. Constructing this forecasting system required a team with expertise ranging from field site experience to software development. Automated near-term iterative forecasting systems will allow the science of ecological forecasting to advance more rapidly and provide the most up-to-date forecasts possible for conservation and management. These forecasting systems will also accelerate basic science by allowing new models of natural systems to be quickly implemented and compared to existing models. Using existing technology, and teams with diverse skill sets, it is possible for ecologists to build these systems and use them to advance our understanding of natural systems.","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/20/268623","DOI":"10.1101/268623","language":"en","author":[{"family":"White","given":"Ethan P."},{"family":"Yenni","given":"Glenda M."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Shawn D."},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Erica M."},{"family":"Bledsoe","given":"Ellen K."},{"family":"Simonis","given":"Juniper L."},{"family":"Ernest","given":"S.

Traditionally, marine biomonitoring involves the sorting and morphological identification of benthic macro-invertebrates, which is time-consuming and taxonomic-expertise demanding. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) represents a promising alternative for benthic monitoring. However, an important fraction of eDNA sequences remains unassigned or belong to taxa of unknown ecology, which prevent their use for assessing the ecological quality status. Here, we show that supervised machine learning (SML) can be used to build robust predictive models for benthic monitoring, regardless of the taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. We tested three SML approaches to assess the environmental impact of marine aquaculture using benthic foraminifera eDNA, a group of unicellular eukaryotes known to be good bioindicators, as features to infer macro-invertebrates based biotic indices. We found similar ecological status as obtained from macro-invertebrates inventories. We argue that SML approaches could overcome and even bypass the cost and time-demanding morpho-taxonomic approaches in future biomonitoring.","DOI":"10.1021/acs.est.7b01518","ISSN":"1520-5851","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Cordier","given":"Tristan"},{"family":"Esling","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Lejzerowicz","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Visco","given":"Joana"},{"family":"Ouadahi","given":"Amine"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Catarina"},{"family":"Cedhagen","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Pawlowski","given":"Jan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"PMID":"28665601","container-title-short":"Environ.

Populations requiring the greatest shifts in allele frequencies to keep pace with future climate change have experienced the largest population declines, suggesting that failure to adapt may have already negatively affected populations.
