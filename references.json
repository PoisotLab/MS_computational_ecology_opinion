In so doing, we highlight the most salient issues needing to be addressed before this approach can be used with a high degree of confidence.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.01941/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.01941","ISSN":"1600-0587","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Leroux","given":"Shawn"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Spencer A."},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Marie-Josée"},{"family":"Baiser","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Cirtwill","given":"Alyssa R."},{"family":"Araújo","given":"Miguel B."},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,2]]},"container-title-short":"Ecography"},

To do so, we conducted an online survey. The 937 respondents were mostly early-career scientists who studied biology as undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of quantitative training: 75% were not satisfied with their understanding of mathematical models; 75% felt that the level of mathematics was \"too low\" in their ecology classes; 90% wanted more mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95% more statistics classes. Respondents thought that 30% of classes in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing programs. The main suggestion to improve quantitative training was to relate theoretical and statistical modeling to applied ecological problems. Improving quantitative training will require dedicated, quantitative classes for ecology-related degrees that contain good mathematical and statistical practice.","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.285","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Barraquand","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Ezard","given":"Thomas H.

Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002053","DOI":"10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00205-3","ISSN":"0304-3800","author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"M.

A conceptual framework and its implementation as models and software","container-title":"Ecology Letters","page":"n/a-n/a","source":"Wiley Online Library","abstract":"Community ecology aims to understand what factors determine the assembly and dynamics of species assemblages at different spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12757/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12757","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Ovaskainen","given":"Otso"},{"family":"Tikhonov","given":"Gleb"},{"family":"Norberg","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Guillaume Blanchet","given":"F."},{"family":"Duan","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Dunson","given":"David"},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Abrego","given":"Nerea"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,22]]},"title-short":"How to make more out of community data?","container-title-short":"Ecol Lett"},

  {"id":"hale09ued","type":"article-journal","title":"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data","container-title":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","page":"8-12","volume":"24","issue":"2","source":"IEEE Xplore","abstract":"At Brown University, there is excitement of having access to the Brown Corpus, containing one million English words. Since then, we have seen several notable corpora that are about 100 times larger, and in 2006, Google released a trillion-word corpus with frequency counts for all sequences up to five words long. In some ways this corpus is a step backwards from the Brown Corpus: it's taken from unfiltered Web pages and thus contains incomplete sentences, spelling errors, grammatical errors, and all sorts of other errors. It's not annotated with carefully hand-corrected part-of-speech tags. But the fact that it's a million times larger than the Brown Corpus outweighs these drawbacks. A trillion-word corpus - along with other Web-derived corpora of millions, billions, or trillions of links, videos, images, tables, and user interactions - captures even very rare aspects of human behavior. So, this corpus could serve as the basis of a complete model for certain tasks - if only we knew how to extract the model from the data.","DOI":"10.1109/MIS.2009.36","ISSN":"1541-1672","author":[{"family":"Halevy","given":"A."},{"family":"Norvig","given":"P."},{"family":"Pereira","given":"F."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]}},
